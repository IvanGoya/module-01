my first ohio state assignment module

        Hello and welcome! 
I have made many modifications to this website so that it meets the the highest of standards, with an emphasis on making the content more accessible to ensure that people with disabilities can view and utilize the code if needed!

There was a broken link on the navigation bar (search engine optimization), which I was able to fix.
There were also many <div> tags that could be modified to more user friendly tags such as <section> and <figure> classes.
The application's CSS style sheet was also moddified in an organized and descriptive manner.
